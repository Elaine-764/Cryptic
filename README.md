# Cryptic

Ciphers: Caesar, RSA, ElGamal, Simple Substitution, Affine, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (to be completed)

Algorithms useful for cryptography [to be developed]: Collision algorithm (for ElGamal attacks), double and add algorithm (for exponentiation with modular arithmetic and elliptic curve point additions)
